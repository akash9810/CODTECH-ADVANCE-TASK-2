Description: Image Classification Objective: The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. Each class represents a distinct object category, such as airplanes, birds, or cars. Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks. It consists of: Training Set: 50,000 images Test Set: 10,000 images

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, and animals. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1]. The CNN architecture includes three convolutional layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for spatial dimension reduction, a flattening layer, and fully connected layers with a softmax output for multi-class classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. It is trained for 10 epochs on 50,000 training images and validated on 10,000 test images. The final test accuracy is reported, and training/validation accuracy and loss are visualized over epochs. Additionally, a 5x5 grid of test images is displayed, showing the model's predictions alongside the true labels. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks by leveraging spatial hierarchies in the data.
